## Quick Start

```bash
# macOS / Linux
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CNTWDev/hushclaw/master/install.sh)

# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CNTWDev/hushclaw/master/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer clones the repo, creates a venv, encrypts the local database with
SQLCipher, wires up PATH, and opens your browser. Existing plaintext databases
and their migration snapshots are upgraded in place with verified atomic
cutover. A setup wizard walks you through the first API key.

```bash
hushclaw serve                  # personal mode (default)
hushclaw                        # interactive REPL
```

No npm or build step is required for normal install/run. The released WebUI
ships prebuilt static assets inside the Python package. No Docker.

---

## Deployment

```bash
bash install.sh
bash install.sh --distro personal  # non-interactive
```

Local-first single-user assistant. All data stays on your device (`~/.local/share/hushclaw/` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/hushclaw/` on macOS). Zero network exposure beyond your chosen model API.

- WebUI at `http://localhost:8765/personal`
- Memory, skills, and config all local
- Upgrade in place: `bash install.sh --update`

## Why HushClaw?

Most agent tools are forgetful by design — each session starts from zero, every preference has to be re-explained, every project context has to be re-established.

HushClaw treats the agent as a long-lived collaborator, not a stateless API wrapper. The longer it runs, the more it knows — about you, your domain, your work patterns, and its own past mistakes.

| | HushClaw |
|---|---|
| **Memory** | 4-dimensional: notes · user profile · domain beliefs · learning reflections |
| **Learning** | Self-improves per turn: reflects on outcomes, patches skills, updates your model |
| **Context** | Stable/dynamic split with Anthropic KV-cache — up to 75% input token savings |
| **Harness** | Session-frozen tool surface · on-demand long-tail tools · queryable per-run latency |
| **Install** | One command; zero-dependency embeddable core, secured runtime extras bundled by the installer |
| **UI** | Full browser interface from the same port as the WebSocket API |
| **Extensibility** | Drop a `.py` to add a tool. Drop a `.md` to add a skill pack. |

---

## Agent OS Architecture

HushClaw is moving toward an **Agent OS kernel + distro** model: one shared runtime kernel, multiple product distributions.

Today the default package is still bundled as:

```
hushclaw = Agent kernel + Personal distro + WebUI/CLI shell
```

The important boundary is already in place:

| Layer | Owns |
|---|---|
| **Kernel** | AgentLoop · ToolRegistry · ContextEngine · MemoryPort · Provider adapters · PolicyGate · AuditEvent |
| **Distro** | runtime profile · enabled tools/skills · policy rules · lifecycle hooks |
| **Shell** | CLI · WebUI · channel entrypoints · HTTP/WebSocket transport |
| **Infra** | local SQLite · model APIs · browser runtime · optional connector SDKs |

Product shells should enter through `DistroRuntime.build()` and `AgentOSService`, not construct kernel pieces directly. The supported packaged distro is `personal` (local-first, single user).

`storage_profile` is distro-declared but kernel-owned. `personal` uses `local_sqlite`.

### Harness v2: stable narrow waist

The registry can contain browser, connector, skill, and domain tools without
sending every schema to the model on every round. A new session freezes one
provider-facing tool surface:

- common tools remain directly callable;
- `tool_search` returns exact schemas for long-tail tools;
- `tool_call` invokes the selected underlying tool through the same policy,
  confirmation, audit, timeout, and verification path;
- the exact schema JSON is persisted for the session, so loop recreation,
  process restarts, and later skill installs do not invalidate its prompt prefix.

With the default browser-enabled registry, the local benchmark exposes 21 of 72
registered tools and reduces estimated tool-schema input from 8,191 to 2,659
tokens (67.5%). Run `python3 scripts/bench_startup.py` to measure the active build.
Set `tools.discovery_mode = "all"` to expose every enabled tool, or `"bridge"`
to force discovery mode. `"auto"` switches when `schema_budget_tokens` is exceeded.

## Memory System

Most memory systems save *what happened*. HushClaw saves *who you are* — across four persistent dimensions visible in the Memories tab:

### 1. Knowledge Base

Raw notes indexed at save time with semantic type:

| Type | What it captures |
|---|---|
| `interest` | Topics you keep returning to |
| `belief` | Opinions and principles you've stated |
| `preference` | How you like to work |
| `fact` | Technical facts, project context |
| `decision` | Choices already locked in |

Recall is hybrid and lazy: **BM25 first** — if the top score exceeds 0.8, skip vector search entirely. Otherwise blend 60% BM25 + 40% cosine. Score-gate → budget-cap → 30 s session cache.

### 2. User Profile

Structured facts extracted from your interaction patterns, organized by category:

```
Preferences · Communication style · Work habits · Focus areas · Ongoing goals · Avoidances
```

These are injected into every prompt as part of the dynamic context suffix — the agent always starts with a current picture of who it's talking to.

### 3. Belief Models

Domain knowledge crystallized from accumulated signals. When you discuss a topic repeatedly, HushClaw synthesizes a coherent model — `latest` view, historical `entries`, `trajectory`, and `summary` — rather than just stacking raw notes.

Each model tracks how your understanding has evolved and marks itself `dirty` when new signals outpace the last consolidation.

### 4. Learning Reflections

After every complex task (3+ tool calls, errors, corrections, or skills used), the runtime reflects:

- **What worked** — outcome, lesson learned, strategy hint
- **What failed** — failure mode classification, corrective signal
- **Skill quality** — 0–100% score per skill used, driving auto-improvement

These accumulate into a searchable reflection log the agent uses to avoid repeating mistakes.

### Recall Tuning

Three knobs to trade determinism for creativity:

```toml
[context]
memory_decay_rate     = 0.002  # Ebbinghaus half-life ~350 days
retrieval_temperature = 0.1    # softmax over recall candidates
serendipity_budget    = 0.10   # 10% of memory tokens = cross-domain wildcards
```

Default is `0.0` for all three — pure deterministic retrieval.

---

## Learning System

HushClaw gets more capable after each session, not just more familiar.

### After every turn
- Lightweight regex fact extraction (zero LLM calls) — interests, beliefs, preferences, decisions auto-extracted and tagged
- Correction signals detected and stored (negative feedback shapes future behavior)

### After complex tasks
- **Trace reflection** — tool call sequence analyzed for success/failure patterns
- **Profile updates** — structured user profile facts written or confidence-updated
- **Skill auto-patch** — single editable skills refined on strong quality signals
- **Skill outcomes** — per-skill quality scores accumulated across sessions

### Belief consolidation
When accumulated belief signals exceed a threshold, the runtime consolidates raw entries into a coherent domain model using an LLM call — without you ever asking it to.

## Token-First Context Engine

The system prompt is split so the expensive half is cache-eligible:

```
STABLE PREFIX  ── KV-cache (Anthropic cache_control) ──────────────────────
  Role · AGENTS.md · SOUL.md
  Budget: context.stable_budget   (default 1500 tokens)

DYNAMIC SUFFIX ── rebuilt every query ──────────────────────────────────────
  Today's date · USER.md · score-gated recalled memories
  Budget: context.dynamic_budget  (default 2500 tokens)
```

When history overflows, the active conversation uses a bounded continuity checkpoint:

| Strategy | Effect |
|---|---|
| `lossless` | Structured continuity summary plus an additional searchable archive |
| `summarize` / `abstractive` | Structured continuity summary; no additional archive. Abstract-only compression is no longer used for active conversations |
| `prune_tool_results` | Replaces older tool outputs with placeholders, retaining valid call/result pairs |

Recent original turns and current user corrections take precedence over older summaries,
working state, and cross-session memory. Durable turns/events remain the source of truth;
summaries are necessarily lossy aids, not a substitute for all session history.

Checkpoints record a retained-message boundary and a fingerprint of the covered prefix.
Restart restores **summary + the complete subsequent conversation**, scoped to the thread.
Changed/excluded history invalidates a checkpoint and falls back to original records.
Summary failure, empty output or truncation keeps the original context; oversized summary
inputs are processed in chunks rather than silently dropped. This can temporarily leave
history above its soft budget when the summary provider is unavailable.

Schema v9 stores these checkpoints in the database (encrypted when database encryption
is enabled). The normal startup migration backs up an existing database before upgrading.
Legacy `summary.md` files and original records are preserved, but unbounded legacy summaries
are no longer used to replace conversation history. The next successful compaction creates
a verified checkpoint; the first long conversation after upgrading may therefore take longer.

## Multi-Agent

```toml
[[gateway.agents]]
name = "researcher"
tools = ["recall", "fetch_url"]

[[gateway.agents]]
name = "writer"
tools = ["remember"]
```

```bash
hushclaw agents pipeline "researcher,writer" "Write a report on RISC-V"
```

Or in chat: `@researcher @writer` for parallel broadcast · `@writer` for single agent · no mention → default routing.

---

## Extensibility

**Custom tools** — drop a `.py` in `~/.config/hushclaw/tools/`:

```python
from hushclaw.tools.base import tool, ToolResult

@tool(name="my_tool", description="Does something useful")
def my_tool(query: str) -> ToolResult:
    return ToolResult.ok(f"Result: {query}")
```

**Skill packs** — a Git repo with `SKILL.md` + optional `tools/*.py`. Install from the Skills panel or CLI.

**Providers** — `anthropic-raw` (default, no deps) · `anthropic-sdk` · `openai-raw` · `ollama` · Anthropic-compatible proxies.

---

## Config

`~/Library/Application Support/hushclaw/hushclaw.toml` (macOS) · `~/.config/hushclaw/hushclaw.toml` (Linux):

```toml
[provider]
name = "anthropic-raw"
# api_key = "sk-..."  # or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var

[agent]
model = "claude-sonnet-4-6"

[context]
compact_strategy      = "lossless"
memory_decay_rate     = 0.0   # > 0 enables Ebbinghaus decay
serendipity_budget    = 0.0   # > 0 enables cross-domain recall wildcards

[memory]
database_encryption   = "sqlcipher"  # default for one-click installs
```

## Local Data Security

One-click installs encrypt the complete SQLite database—including messages,
memories, tasks, file metadata, and search indexes—with SQLCipher. The 256-bit
database key is kept in macOS Keychain, Windows current-user DPAPI, or Linux
Secret Service. On a headless machine where no credential vault is available,
HushClaw uses an owner-only key file and reports the fallback so it is never
mistaken for equivalent protection.

```bash
hushclaw database status       # encryption, key source, schema and integrity
hushclaw database harden       # repair owner-only filesystem permissions
hushclaw database encrypt      # idempotent migration for a developer install
hushclaw database recovery-key # sensitive: copy once and keep offline
hushclaw doctor
```

Keep the recovery key in a password manager or offline vault. HushClaw backup
archives preserve SQLCipher encryption and deliberately exclude device-local
key files. On another machine, `backup import` securely prompts for the recovery
key; non-interactive automation can pipe it with `--database-key-stdin` or set
`HUSHCLAW_DATABASE_KEY`.

This protects files at rest from casual inspection and ordinary SQLite tools.
It cannot protect data after HushClaw has unlocked it from malware controlling
your login session, process-memory inspection, or a compromised OS. FileVault,
BitLocker, or LUKS is still recommended for whole-device protection.

## Backup & Migration

Create a portable backup archive before moving to a new machine:

```bash
hushclaw backup export
hushclaw backup export ~/Desktop/hushclaw-backup.zip
```

Restore it on the new machine:

```bash
hushclaw backup import ~/Desktop/hushclaw-backup.zip
```

By default the archive includes your `hushclaw.toml`, local data directory, and
custom tools from the config directory. If the source database is encrypted,
the archived database remains encrypted and no key material is included. Use
`--data-dir` during import if you want to restore into a different location on
the new machine; enter the offline recovery key when prompted.

## Install Options

```bash
# Installer flags
bash install.sh                        # install and start
bash install.sh --distro personal      # skip prompt, personal mode
bash install.sh --update               # pull latest, restart
bash install.sh --stop                 # stop running server
bash install.sh --uninstall            # remove (prompts about data)
bash install.sh --uninstall --purge    # remove everything including data

# Developer install
git clone https://github.com/CNTWDev/hushclaw.git && cd hushclaw
pip install -e ".[server,encryption]" # server + SQLCipher database support
pip install -e ".[all]"       # everything (browser, web fetch, all extras)

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

**Requirements:** Python 3.11+ · no mandatory third-party packages for the
embeddable core · API key for the chosen provider (or a running Ollama
instance). The one-click installer adds WebSocket, calendar, and SQLCipher
runtime extras automatically.
